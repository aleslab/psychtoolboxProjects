function [ mergedStruct ] = updateStruct( intoStruct, fromStruct )
%updateStruct Updates a structure with new fields and values 
%[ mergedStruct] = updateStruct( intoStruct, fromStruct )
%
%   Update structure is used when you have two disparate structures you
%   wnat to merge into one structure. WARNING: Values in intoStruct will be
%   overwritten by values in fromStruct if fieldnames are the same. Does
%   not work for array of structures, only single-element
%
%   Usage: [mergedStruct] = updateStruct(intoStruct,fromStruct) Takes the
%   fields from "fromStruct" and adds them to "intoStruct". If a fieldnames
%   are
%    
%   intoStruct = Single element structure we will be adding/changing.
%   fromStruct = Single element structure we are taking from.
%
%   mergedStruct = output combined structure.
